# Project Discussion: Solace Candidate Assignment

Hey there! I'm excited to dive into the approach I took with this Solace candidate assignment. This was a fun challenge to build a modern web app for searching and managing advocates, and I learned a ton along the way. Let me break down my thought process, the fixes I implemented, and where we could take this next.

## Overall Approach

I started by analyzing the requirements and decided to build a full-stack Next.js application with a focus on performance, user experience, and maintainable code. The backend uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations, while the frontend leverages React with Zustand for state management and Tailwind for styling. I prioritized clean architecture, proper error handling, and responsive design from the get-go.

## Fixes and Functionality Improvements

### Frontend (FE) Improvements

- **Search and Filter Integration**: Fixed a critical bug where search terms and advanced filters weren't combining properly with AND logic. Now when you search for "John" and filter by "New York", you get advocates named John in New York. This involved updating the debouncing logic and ensuring filter state updates immediately.

- **Filter State Management**: Resolved issues with filter dropdowns sending stale values to the API. Implemented synchronous state updates and direct value overrides to ensure newly selected filters are used immediately in API calls.

- **UI Responsiveness and Accessibility**: Enhanced the interface with better loading states, error handling, and keyboard navigation. Added ARIA labels, focus management, and screen reader support throughout the app.

- **Performance Optimizations**: Replaced custom debounce implementations with the `use-debounce` library for more reliable input handling. Added React.memo for component optimization and lazy loading for better bundle splitting.

### Backend (BE) Improvements

- **API Robustness**: Strengthened the search API with better input validation, caching, and error handling. Added comprehensive filtering capabilities for multiple criteria with proper SQL query building.

- **Database Optimization**: Implemented indexing strategies and connection pooling for better performance. Added unique constraints and proper data types to prevent data integrity issues.

- **Caching Layer**: Integrated Redis-based caching with TTL to reduce database load and improve response times for frequently accessed data.

## Code Organization Changes

I restructured the codebase for better maintainability and scalability:

- **Component Separation**: Split monolithic components into smaller, focused ones (SearchBar, AdvancedFilters, etc.) with clear single responsibilities.

- **State Management Migration**: Moved from React Context to Zustand for more efficient state handling, better debugging with DevTools, and automatic persistence.

- **Type Safety**: Introduced comprehensive TypeScript types and Zod schemas for runtime validation, eliminating many potential bugs.

- **Folder Structure**: Organized code into logical directories (components, stores, hooks, utils) with consistent import paths.

## Major Libraries Added

- **use-debounce**: For reliable input debouncing instead of custom setTimeout logic. This prevents excessive API calls and improves user experience with smoother search interactions.

- **Zustand**: Replaced Context for state management. It's lighter, has better performance, and provides built-in persistence and debugging tools.

- **Drizzle ORM**: For type-safe database operations. It generates SQL at build time and provides excellent TypeScript integration compared to raw SQL.

- **React Hook Form + Zod**: For form handling and validation. This gives us real-time validation, better UX, and type-safe form data.

## Future Improvements

Looking ahead, here are some areas we could enhance:

- **Advanced Search Features**: Implement fuzzy search, autocomplete suggestions, and search result highlighting.

- **Data Visualization**: Add charts and graphs for advocate statistics (e.g., distribution by degree, experience levels).

- **Bulk Operations**: Allow selecting multiple advocates for bulk editing or exporting.

- **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for live data updates.

- **API Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Expand unit and integration tests, especially for the complex filter logic.

- **Performance Monitoring**: Integrate tools like Sentry for error tracking and performance metrics.

- **Mobile App**: Create a React Native companion app for on-the-go advocate management.

What do you think about these priorities? Should we focus on search enhancements first, or would you prefer to tackle the data visualization features? Also, are there any specific libraries or frameworks you'd like me to consider for future development?
