# Project Discussion: Solace Candidate Assignment

Hey there! I'm excited to dive into the approach I took with this Solace candidate assignment. This was a fun challenge to build a modern web app for searching and managing advocates, and I learned a ton along the way. Let me break down my thought process, the fixes I implemented, and where we could take this next.

## Chief Improvements

Throughout the development process, several key improvements transformed the project from a basic implementation to a production-ready application:

- **Database Performance**: Added strategic indices to the advocates table and implemented a dedicated search API endpoint for optimized query performance
- **Search & Filter Logic**: Fixed critical AND logic bugs in search and filter combinations, ensuring accurate results when multiple criteria are applied
- **State Management**: Migrated from React Context to Zustand for better performance, debugging capabilities, and automatic persistence
- **Code Quality**: Established comprehensive linting, automated code reviews with CodeRabbit, and proper Gitflow practices
- **User Experience**: Enhanced UI with professional styling, accessibility improvements, and reliable search debouncing

## Development Approach

I broke down the development into 4 major iterative steps, each building on the previous while maintaining a focus on code quality, user experience, and performance. Each step was implemented through dedicated feature branches to ensure clean Gitflow practices and thorough code review.

### Step 1: Project Setup & Quality Foundation
Established the development environment with proper tooling, linting, and code review processes. This included setting up Husky pre-commit hooks, ESLint configuration, and enabling automated code reviews with CodeRabbit.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Development Tooling**: Set up Husky pre-commit hooks with ESLint and commitlint for code quality enforcement
- **Code Review Process**: Enabled automated code reviews with CodeRabbit for consistent quality standards
- **Version Management**: Implemented proper versioning and changelog maintenance

**Pull Request:** [#1](https://github.com/trose/solace-candidate-assignment/pull/1) - Polish and setup improvements

### Step 2: Code Architecture & Component Organization
Restructured the monolithic codebase into maintainable, focused components with clear separation of concerns. Implemented proper error handling, separated server and client components for optimal performance, and established consistent import patterns.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Component Separation**: Split monolithic components into focused, single-responsibility components (SearchBar, AdvancedFilters, AdvocateTable, etc.)
- **Error Handling**: Improved error boundaries and user-friendly error messages throughout the application
- **Performance Optimization**: Separated server and client components for progressive page loading and better bundle optimization
- **Type Safety**: Introduced comprehensive TypeScript types and Zod schemas for runtime validation

**Pull Request:** [#2](https://github.com/trose/solace-candidate-assignment/pull/2) - Enhance code quality and architecture

### Step 3: Core Functionality & Performance Optimization
Fixed critical search and filter integration bugs, optimized database queries with proper indexing, and implemented caching strategies for better performance.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Search and Filter Integration**: Fixed critical bug where search terms and advanced filters weren't combining with proper AND logic
- **Filter State Management**: Resolved issues with filter dropdowns sending stale values by implementing synchronous state updates
- **Database Optimization**: Added strategic indices to the advocates table on searchable fields (name, city, degree, specialties) and created database migration files for performance improvements
- **Search API Endpoint**: Implemented a dedicated `/api/advocates/search` endpoint with comprehensive filtering capabilities, input validation, and optimized SQL query building

**Pull Requests:** [#4](https://github.com/trose/solace-candidate-assignment/pull/4) - Implement database performance optimizations and server-side search, [#9](https://github.com/trose/solace-candidate-assignment/pull/9) - Search and filtering AND logic

### Step 4: UI/UX Architecture & State Management
Enhanced the user interface with professional styling, improved state management using Zustand for better performance and debugging capabilities, and optimized user interactions with reliable search debouncing.

**Implementation Details:**
- **State Management Migration**: Replaced React Context with Zustand for more efficient state handling, better debugging with DevTools, and automatic persistence capabilities
- **UI Enhancements**: Updated styling to match professional standards with improved header design and responsive layout
- **User Experience**: Replaced custom debounce implementations with the `use-debounce` library for reliable input handling and smoother search interactions
- **Accessibility**: Added ARIA labels, focus management, and keyboard navigation support

**Pull Requests:** [#6](https://github.com/trose/solace-candidate-assignment/pull/6) - UI UX improvements, [#8](https://github.com/trose/solace-candidate-assignment/pull/8) - Update styling to mimic Solace brand and improvements


## Development Tools

Throughout the development process, I leveraged several powerful tools to enhance productivity and code quality:

- **VSCode with opencode**: Used Visual Studio Code with the opencode extension powered by Grok-code-fast-1 for intelligent code completion, refactoring suggestions, and rapid development assistance.

- **CodeRabbit GitHub Plugin**: Integrated CodeRabbit's automated code review system to provide consistent, AI-powered feedback on code quality, best practices, and potential issues during the review process.

- **Postico2 for Database GUI**: Utilized Postico2 as a PostgreSQL database GUI for efficient database management, query testing, and data visualization during development and debugging.

## Future Improvements

Looking ahead, here are some areas we could enhance:

- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**: Set up automated testing, building, and deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions to ensure code quality, run tests on every push, and enable automated deployments to staging and production environments.

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Implement secure user authentication (OAuth, JWT) and role-based access control to protect advocate data and enable user-specific features like saved searches and personal dashboards.

- **Advanced Search with Redisearch**: Investigate Redisearch for lightweight inverted index search capabilities, enabling faster fuzzy matching, autocomplete, and semantic search across advocate profiles without heavy database queries.

- **End-to-End & Unit Testing**: Expand testing coverage with comprehensive unit tests for all components and utilities, plus Playwright-based E2E tests to ensure critical user workflows (search, filter, pagination) work reliably across browsers.

- **Advanced Search Features**: Implement fuzzy search, autocomplete suggestions, semantic search and search result highlighting.

- **Bulk Operations**: Allow selecting multiple advocates for bulk editing or exporting.

- **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for live data updates across concurrent sessions.

- **API Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage.

- **Performance Monitoring**: Integrate tools like Sentry for error tracking and performance metrics.

- **Mobile App**: Create a React Native companion app for on-the-go advocate management.
